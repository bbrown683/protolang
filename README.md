# Spark
Spark is a programming language which I am working on as a learning experience. The aim is a functional programming language similar to that of F# which can be compiled into bytecode and ran by the JVM.

# Example
```
package foo.bar

public object DayOfWeek =
    | MONDAY
    | TUESDAY
    | WEDNESDAY
    | THURSDAY
    | FRIDAY
```
